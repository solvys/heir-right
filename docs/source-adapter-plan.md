# HeirRight Source Adapter Plan

Status: Friday implementation v1  
Purpose: define how planned public sources feed the raw dossier engine.

## Adapter Output Principle

Adapters return normalized `SourceFact[]`. They do not decide CRM state, score, outreach strategy, or legal interpretation. The dossier builder converts facts into claims, title events, review flags, document fields, and CRM adapter dry-run payloads.

Minimum adapter output:

```ts
type SourceFact = {
  id: string;
  runId: string;
  source: SourceKey;
  rawId: string;
  fetchedAt: string;
  county: string;
  subject: {
    ownerName?: string;
    propertyAddress?: string;
    parcelId?: string;
    caseNumber?: string;
    county?: string;
  };
  factType: FactType;
  value: unknown;
  confidence: number;
  sourceUrl?: string;
  reviewFlags: ReviewFlag[];
};
```

## Friday Source Scope

| Source | Friday posture | Primary inputs | Output facts | Blocker behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Miami-Dade Property Appraiser | Live app reachability + public search URL; structured extraction where feasible | address, owner, folio | source status, search URL, seed address/owner/folio/county facts | `SOURCE_HEALTH_ONLY`, `MISSING_PROPERTY_FACT`, source refs |
| Miami-Dade Official Records / Clerk | Live app reachability + title-signal placeholder; browser/API extraction next | owner, address, folio | official-record status, title-signal review event | `MISSING_TITLE_FACT`, source refs |
| Landing/intake | Local dry-run seed | address, owner, county, folio | intake seed fact | missing fields become review flags |
| Podio | Dry-run only unless config exists | raw dossier | CRM payload fact | missing credentials block live sync |
| Document packet | Draft internal summary first | raw dossier | document output fact | `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED` |

## Workflow-Informed Source Backlog

The workflow PDF expands the source plan beyond the Friday public-source slice. These sources should be modeled explicitly so the system can distinguish automated public checks from manual, paid, or compliance-sensitive steps.

| Source/workflow | Posture | Primary inputs | Output facts | Guardrail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Estate-name search | First-class input path | estate name, owner name, case number | estate seed, possible owner, possible probate case | Never infer heirship without source refs |
| Owner type qualification | Automatable when source exposes owner type | owner name, property record | individual owner, company owner, trust/estate owner, disqualification status | Company-owned properties default out of scope |
| Recent sale / deed history | Public-source target | folio, address, owner, OR book/page | deed event, sale date, book/page, ownership activity | Sale within 5 years defaults disqualified/review |
| Adverse possession | Public-source target where available | owner, address, folio | adverse-possession claim/status | Missing signal becomes review flag |
| Tax history | Public-source target | folio, address, owner | unpaid tax years, tax amount, receipt status, reassessment, payer identity | PDF receipt download stays manual until validated |
| Civil/family/probate docket | Public-source target | estate name, decedent, case number | case status, docket refs, affidavit of heirs, document availability | No legal conclusion; record-only facts |
| Marriage licenses | Public-source target | decedent/heir names | marriage-license signal, spouse hypothesis | Human review required |
| Obituary/death indicators | Public web/manual target | name, DOB/DOD, location | obituary link, death date, family names | Human review required |
| Voter/professional/license/incarceration records | Manual/public target | name, DOB, address | possible address/status signal | Do not use without source policy review |
| Code enforcement / door knock / neighbor research | Manual-only | property address, case details | manual task, photos/notes, officer contact | Never automate external contact by default |
| IDI / Intelius / Ancestry / ForeWarn / VitalChek / PI | Paid/manual source | identity, address, DOB/DOD | contact/address/family tree evidence | Requires client credentials and storage approval |

## SourceRef Rule

Every dossier claim must have at least one source ref or a review flag explaining why it is not source-confirmed.

Example:

```json
{
  "source": "property_appraiser",
  "rawId": "property-search:20611-nw-33rd-pl-miami-gardens-fl-33056:status",
  "fetchedAt": "2026-05-19T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Every source ref must also identify its access class:

- `public_automated`
- `public_manual`
- `paid_manual`
- `paid_automated_pending_approval`
- `operator_observed`
- `client_supplied`

## Stop Conditions

Stop and report a blocker instead of forcing source extraction when:

- a source requires login or authenticated access without approval;
- a source presents CAPTCHA or anti-automation controls;
- a source returns repeated 403/429 responses;
- the public app is reachable but structured records require endpoint discovery;
- fetching would violate a known source restriction.

## Degradation Rules

- One blocked source must not fail the whole run.
- Missing facts create visible `reviewFlags`.
- Friday mode must not synthesize tax, probate, death, lien, or heirship facts.
- Friday mode must not use enrichment or skip trace.
- Friday mode can produce source-health facts while marking unverified property/title claims for review.
- Paid/manual facts may be represented as placeholders or task requirements, but should not be synthesized as completed evidence.
- Outreach facts must remain task/status metadata until compliance approval exists.
